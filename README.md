# Melodate (Machine Learning part)

## Introduction

Melodate is a music preference-based dating application that aims to create a more authentic and personalized matchmaking experience by utilizing users' music tastes. By focusing on musical interests rather than superficial qualities, Melodate connects users with potential matches who share similar lifestyle compatibilities and music preferences, enhancing the likelihood of meaningful connections.

# Machine Learning Overview

## Objective

The objective of recommender feature is to develop a sophisticated recommender system that can accurately predict and suggest potential matches based on users' music preferences. This system is at the core of Melodate's functionality, enabling the application to pair individuals based on shared musical tastes rather than traditional, often superficial matchmaking criteria.

The primary goal of anti porn feature is to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between safe-for-work (SFW) and not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content in images.
